// relationshipSQLTpl defines the template for a SQL query used to
// query buddy list and privacy relationships between a
// user (`me`) and other users in the system.
//
// This query serves two purposes:
// 1. Retrieve all relationships for the user.
// 2. If filtering is enabled (`.DoFilter` is true), retrieve all relationships filtered on a specific list of users.
//
// The query creates a unified view of both server-side buddy lists and client-side buddy lists.
